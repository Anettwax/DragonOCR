# DragonOCR

DragonOCR is a Python-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that utilizes the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from images. 
Text from images is extracted using Tesseract and then processed to create XLSX files for easy manipulation and analysis.

TLDR: you put images in, it gives you XLSX files out.

The design is very human.

## Usage

1. make directory `in/` in the same directory as the script and put images in it.
2. run the script.
3. check the `out/` directory for the output XLSX files.
